    <p>fpcurator is a collection of tools for performing certain curation tasks easier. There are four sub-tools available. Note that the tool may freeze while performing any task. All debug info on any task is printed to the console the program should have launched with.</p>
    
    <h2>Auto Curator</h2>
    <p>The Auto Curator tool generates a bunch of partial curations based upon a list of urls containing the games to curate. The list of curatable websites is limited the site definitions in the "sites" folder next to the program.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>Here are a list of options:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Save</b> - When checked, the auto curator will save it's progress so if it fails from an error, the tool will resume where it left off given the same urls.</li>
        <li><b>Use Titles</b> - When checked, the auto curator will use the titles of curated games instead of a randomly generated uuid.</li>
        <li><b>Clear URLs</b> - When checked, the auto curator will clear any urls in the list when they are curated. Errored urls will remain in the list.</li>
        <li><b>Show Done</b> - When checked, the auto curator will show a message box when it is done curating.</li>
    </ul>
    Here is some basic usage steps:
    <ol>
        <li>Select the options you want, specified by the list above, and set the output directory of these partial curations.</li>
        <li>Paste the urls you want to curate into the text box, one per line.</li>
        <li>Press the "Curate" button to start the curation process.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Download URLs</h2>
    <p>The Download URLs tool downloads and formats a list of files from a list of urls into a collection of organized folders inside the directory specified by "Output Folder". It works in a similar way to cURLsDownloader, but is powered by fpclib. Put all the urls you want to download into the textbox and press "Download".<br>
    &nbsp;<br>Here are a list of options:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Remove "web.archive.org"</b> - When checked, the downloader will put all urls downloaded from the web archive back into their original domains.</li>
        <li><b>Keep URLVars</b> - When checked, the downloader will append url vars present on links being downloaded to the end of the html file. This is only necessary when you have two links to the same webpage that generate different html due to the url vars.</li>
        <li><b>Clear URLs</b> - When checked, the downloader will clear any urls in the list when they are downloaded. Errored urls will remain in the list.</li>
        <li><b>Show Done</b> - When checked, the downloader will show a message box when it is done downloading.</li>
    </ul>
    Here is some basic usage steps:
    <ol>
        <li>Select the options you want, specified by the list above, and set the output directory of the downloaded folders and files.</li>
        <li>Paste the urls you want to download into the text box, one per line.</li>
        <li>Press the "Download" button to start the download process.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Search</h2>
    <p>The Search tool can take a list of titles and a list of urls for those titles and bulk check how likely it is those entries are in Flashpoint. You will need to load the Flashpoint database for it to check through, in addition to providing regexes that will be used to check if entries in Flashpoint have the right Source, Publisher, or Developer that would match a title in the list. Note that this will cache the database for later use, so if you want to reload it you'll need to either delete the file "search/database.tsv" or press "Load" on the database again.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>Here are a list of options:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Priorities</b> - When checked, the searcher will generate a list of numeric priorities and print them into a file named "priorities.txt" next to the program. This is mainly used for copying into a spreadsheet.</li>
        <li><b>Log</b> - When checked, the searcher will generate a more human readable log displaying how likely each it is those games are in Flashpoint.</li>
        <li><b>Strip Subtitles</b> - When checked, titles will be stripped of subtitles when searching for them in Flashpoint.</li>
        <li><b>Exact Url Matches</b> - When unchecked, the searcher will skip checking for exact url matches for a game match in Flashpoint. Normally an exact url match is a very good indicator if a game is curated, but this is optional in case multiple games are on the same url.</li>
        <li><b>Use difflib</b> - When checked, the searcher will use the default python difflib instead of the fast and efficient python-Levenshtein.</li>
    </ul>
    Here is some basic usage steps:
    <ol>
        <li>Select the Flashpoint database, located in your Flashpoint folder under "/Data/flashpoint.sqlite".</li>
        <li>Select the options you want, specified by the list above.</li>
        <li>Type in a source regex that would match the source of any game in Flashpoint that comes from the same location as those in the list. The regex match is case-insensitive.</li>
        <li>Type in a developer/publisher regex that would match the developer/publisher of any game in Flashpoint that comes from the same location as those in the list. Note that developers/publishers are stripped of all non-alphanumeric characters (except semicolons) and are set to lowercase ("Cool-Math-Games.com" becomes "coolmathgamescom"), so the match is case-insensitive.</li>
        <li>Copy and paste the <b>TITLES</b> of entries to search with in the <b>LEFT</b> box, one per line.</li>
        <li>Copy and paste the <b>URLS</b> of entries to search with in the <b>RIGHT</b> box, one per line.</li>
        <li>Press the "Search" button to initiate the search. When the search is done the generated "log.txt" and/or "priorities.txt" files will be automatically opened if you chose to generate them.</li>
    </ol>
    Here's what each of the priorities mean:
    <ul>
    <table>
        <tr><td><b> -1        </b></td><td>Duplicate</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>  5        </b></td><td>Exact url matches with the source of a game in Flashpoint</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>  4.9      </b></td><td>Exact url matches ignoring protocol and extra source data (like Via. Wayback)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>  4.8      </b></td><td>Title matches with a game that is from the same source/developer/publisher</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>  4.3      </b></td><td>Title starts the title of a game from the same source/developer/publisher (and is >10 characters long)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>  4.0      </b></td><td>Title matches with a game in Flashpoint (may not be accurate for common names of games like Chess)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>  3.9      </b></td><td>Title starts the title of a game in Flashpoint (and is >10 characters long)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>  3.8      </b></td><td>Title is in the title of a game in Flashpoint (and is >10 characters long)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>  3.6-3.8  </b></td><td>This game has a very high (>95%) metric, meaning it matches with another title that probably has 1 or 2 letters different.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>  3-3.6    </b></td><td>This game has a medium to high metric (85-95%), meaning it kind of matches with games in Flashpoint but not really.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>  1-3      </b></td><td>Basically every other metric (60-85%). 60% is the highest match of garbage letters.</td></tr>
    </table>
    </ul>
